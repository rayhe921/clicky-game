clicky-game
Interactive image clicking game using React.

The goal of the game is to see how many Pokemon you can click without clicking the same image twice. The more unique pokemon you can click in a row the higher your score will be. Also with each click the image grid will randomize making it more difficult to remember which pokemon was previously clicked. If you click the same pokemon twice the game will be over.
